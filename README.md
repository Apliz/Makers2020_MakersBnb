# User stories

The following are the user stories the team generated from the project specification\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Host that has a space,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I can advertise my space,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to be able to list my space.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a User,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I can see all of the properties,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be able to see a list of uploaded spaces.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a User,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I can use the website and it remembers me,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to be able to sign up my details to the website.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Host,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I can list all of my properties,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be able to list multiple spaces on the website.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Host,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I can advertise my space,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to be able to add a name and description to a space.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Host,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I can make a profit,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to be able to add a list price to my space.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Guest,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I can hire a space that I like,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to be able to request a reservation for 1 night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a technician,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that customers donâ€™t double book,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remove availability when a reservation is completed.
